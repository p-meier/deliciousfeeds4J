{"name":"Deliciousfeeds4j","tagline":"deliciousfeeds4J is a wrapper for the delicious Feeds-API v2.","body":"#deliciousfeeds4J - Wrapper for delicious feeds-API v2\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\n\r\nI started this project in order to build a recommender to find new and interesting links and websites by using delicious. They have an API for posting links and managing your account - a wrapper for this can be found here: [https://github.com/czarneckid/delicious-java](https://github.com/czarneckid/delicious-java).\r\n\r\nBut they also have another API called \"delicious feeds\" where you can retrieve information in JSON- or RSS-format. This library wraps this feeds API in an comfortable way to work with.\r\n\r\nA few examples of what you can get:\r\n- Recent bookmarks posted on delicious\r\n- Public bookmarks for a specific user\r\n- Public summary information about a user\r\n- Recent bookmarks for a URL\r\n- Summary information about a URL\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nHere is the API documentation from delicious: [https://delicious.com/developers](https://delicious.com/developers)\r\n\r\n##License\r\nIf you find deliciousfeeds4J useful or have issues please drop me a line, I would love to hear how you're using it.\r\n\r\ndeliciousfeeds4J is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, see the LICENSE file for more details.\r\n\r\n##A small example of usage\r\nSimple and easy to use - here an example of finding the 10 most recent bookmarks posted on delicious (from all users):\r\n\r\n    //Create an instance\r\n    final DeliciousFeeds deliciousFeeds = new DeliciousFeeds();\r\n\r\n    //Expand Urls (defaults to false) - Some Urls are shortened like this 'http://icio.us/+a7f570d6d6842'\r\n    //and get expanded to with that option to this: 'http://www.competitionline.com/de/wettbewerbe/116699'\r\n    deliciousFeeds.setExpandUrls(true);\r\n\r\n    //Set a proper userAgent-String (recommended by delicious - but did not cause any trouble during my\r\n    //tests without it (default is: 'deliciousfeeds4j Java/1.7'))\r\n    deliciousFeeds.setUserAgent(\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; rv:16.0.1)\");\r\n\r\n    //Find the 10 most recent bookmarks\r\n    final List<Bookmark> bookmarks = deliciousFeeds.findBookmarks();\r\n\r\n##Wiki, Issue-Tracker and further documentation\r\nI am working on more documentation and the like but the sample above should be enough to get you started.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
